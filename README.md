# Light-and-Sound-Memory-Game
Pre-work for CodePath Internship

**Light and Sound Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Preston Powell**

Time spent: **11** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com/edit/#!/beryl-valuable-oatmeal?path=script.js%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [$] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [$] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [$] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [$] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [$] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [$] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [$] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [$] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://www.w3schools.com/, https://stackoverflow.com/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I had during this project was understanding the logic flow between the js functions. It took me a while to understand what playSingleClue and playClueSequence did, and how they interacted, but after following through the code while executing, it made more sense to me. Another challenge I faced was the syntax. I am not the most familiar with JavaScript, so there was a bit of learning to be done while I coded. While the language is quite simple and easy to read, the built-in functions are the most interesting part of any language to me, and I want to learn more about how methods like setTimeout and the Sound Synthesis Functions work.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[In the realm of web programming, I have many questions regarding API's, webscraping, and data management/transfer. I believe the best way to learn is through hands-on experience, and I am eager to have this opportunity with CodePath to possibly learn as much as I can about these topics. I want to know how API's work, and their fundamental components as well. I want to know how people are able to scan for and collect certain data from websites. I want to have a very strong knowledge of how to handle data, so that I can use the skill in self-guided projects.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would implement a levelling system: After pressing the start button (or perhaps before), you would be able to choose which difficulty you would like to play on. On higher difficulties, the length of played clues decreases, and so does the time in between each consecutive clue, and on the hardest difficulty, if you don't answer within a certain period of time, you lose.]
